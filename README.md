# Language Models use Lookbacks to Track Beliefs

This repository contains the code and experiments for the paper ["Language Models use Lookbacks to Track Beliefs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14685) by Prakash et al. The work investigates how language models (specifically Llama-3-70B-Instruct) represent and track characters' beliefs usin

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nix07/mind.git
cd mind
```

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate belief
```

3. Configure `env.yml` with following environment variables:
- Set `NDIF_KEY` for API access
- Set `HF_WRITE` for Hugging Face access

4. Download the singular vector tensors from [here]() at the repo directory.

## Usage

The repository contains several components:

1. **Dataset**: The `data/` contains the CausalToM templates and synthetic entities used to generate samples. Additionally, it also contains BigToM samples. `src/dataset.py` file contains code for generating and processing the CausalToM dataset.

2. **Experiments**: The `experiments/` directory contains configurations and results for various experiments investigating the underlying mechanisms. Use notebooks in `experiments/causalToM_novis` and `experiments/causalToM_vis` for mechanism exploration. Notebooks do not include subspace intervention experiments. Use `scripts/run_single_layer_patching_exps.py` and `scripts/run_single_layer_patching_exps.py`, which includes subspace interchange intervention experiments, with appropriate arguments to scale up the experiments.

3. **Utilities**: Utilities are included in their respective directories.
