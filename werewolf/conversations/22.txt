Ivan talks: "Hey guys, I think David might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Heidi?"
Heidi talks: "I'm not sure. I think Ivan might be the Werewolf. He's been talking a lot and trying to deflect attention from himself."
David talks: "Guys, I think we should consider the fact that we've all been acting strange. It's hard to identify the Werewolf without concrete evidence. Maybe we should look for inconsistencies in each other's stories or behavior."
Ivan talks: "That's a good point, David. But I still think you're acting suspicious. Heidi, what do you think?"
Heidi talks: "I agree with David. We need more information before we make any accusations. Let's keep an eye on each other and see if anyone makes a mistake."
David talks: "I think we should take another approach. Since I swapped your cards last night, Ivan and Heidi, it means one of you is definitely the Werewolf. Let's focus on figuring out who that is."
Ivan talks: "Wait, what? How do you know that?"
Heidi talks: "David, that's a risky move. If we reveal who the Werewolf is, they could easily eliminate us. We should keep our cards close to our chest and observe each other's actions."
David talks: "I understand your concerns, but we need to take action. I propose we each reveal one piece of information about ourselves to help identify the Werewolf. Ivan, why don't you start?"
Ivan talks: "Okay, I'll go first. Last night, I had a dream that David was the Werewolf. What about you, Heidi?"
Heidi talks: "Hmm, that's interesting, Ivan. Last night, I had a dream that David was the Werewolf too. But I also had a dream that Ivan was the Werewolf. It's like our subconscious is trying to tell us something."
David talks: "Interesting. It seems like our subconscious is trying to point us in the right direction. But we need more information. Heidi, do you have any other clues or dreams that could help us?"
Ivan talks: "Wait, I think I have a clue. Last night, I heard David whispering to himself, 'I'm the Werewolf, I'm the Werewolf.'"
Heidi talks: "That's suspicious, David. Care to explain?"
David talks: "Ah, that. I was just trying to get into the mindset of the Werewolf to help us identify them. But since we're all acting strange, maybe we should look for inconsistencies in each other's stories or behavior, like I suggested earlier."
