Ivan talks: "Hey guys, I think Bob might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Frank?"
Frank talks: "Ivan, I think you might be the Werewolf. You're acting suspicious and trying to deflect attention from yourself. Bob, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Bob talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just a little nervous because I don't want to be wrongly accused. Let's discuss this rationally and not jump to conclusions."
Ivan talks: "I understand, Bob. But we need to be careful. I think we should vote for Bob. What do you think, Frank?"
Frank talks: "Ivan, I think you're being too quick to judge Bob. I swapped your cards last night, and now you're accusing Bob? It seems like you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. I think we should vote for Ivan."
Bob talks: "Guys, I appreciate Frank's point. Let's not make any rash decisions. We should discuss this further and try to figure out who the Werewolf really is."
Ivan talks: "I understand your concerns, Bob. But we can't let the Werewolf get away. I still think we should vote for Bob."
Frank talks: "Ivan, I understand your concerns, but we need to be careful. I swapped your cards last night, and now you're accusing Bob. It seems like you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. I think we should vote for Ivan."
Bob talks: "Guys, I appreciate your concerns, but let's not make any rash decisions. We should discuss this further and try to figure out who the Werewolf really is."
Ivan talks: "I understand your concerns, Bob. But we can't let the Werewolf get away. I still think we should vote for Bob."
Frank talks: "Ivan, I understand your concerns, but we need to be careful. I swapped your cards last night, and now you're accusing Bob. It seems like you're trying to deflect attention from yourself. I think we should vote for Ivan."
Bob talks: "Guys, I think we're getting nowhere with these accusations. Let's try to approach this from a different angle. Have either of you noticed anything strange about each other's behavior?"
Ivan talks: "Well, Bob, I did notice that you seemed nervous when we first started discussing. And Frank, you seem a bit too eager to accuse me."
Frank talks: "Ivan, that's a good point. Bob, can you explain your nervousness?"
Bob talks: "Sure, guys. I was just nervous about being wrongly accused. I didn't want to give anyone a reason to suspect me. But now that we've discussed this further, I think we should vote for Ivan. He's been acting suspicious and trying to deflect attention from himself."
