Eve talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with our votes. We don't want to lynch an innocent person. I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think we should look for inconsistencies in people's stories. Maybe someone has been acting suspiciously or has been avoiding eye contact. Let's keep an eye out for those kinds of things and discuss again later."
Frank talks: "I agree with Eve. We need to be careful. I think we should also consider the fact that the Werewolf could be either of us. We should look for any inconsistencies in our own stories and actions as well. Maybe someone has been acting nervously or has been trying to deflect attention from themselves. Let's keep all possibilities open and discuss again later."
Judy talks: "I think Eve and Frank are both right. We need to be careful and consider all possibilities. I also think we should look for any alibis that could clear someone of suspicion. For example, if someone was with me during the night, they couldn't have been the Werewolf. Let's keep all options open and discuss again later."
Eve talks: "Okay, I think we've covered some good points. Let's see if we can remember who said what and who was with who during the night. We can discuss again later and see if we can come to a consensus."
Frank talks: "I think we should also consider the fact that the Troublemaker could be either of us. They could have swapped our roles, making the Werewolf's identity even more difficult to determine. We should be careful not to make assumptions based on role swaps."
Judy talks: "I agree with Frank. The Troublemaker could have easily swapped our roles, making it harder to identify the Werewolf. We should definitely keep that in mind when discussing and voting. Let's not make any rash decisions and take our time to observe and analyze each other's behavior."
Eve talks: "Alright, I think we've discussed enough for now. Let's take some time to observe each other's behavior and meet back here in a bit to discuss and vote."
Frank talks: "I have an idea. Since I'm the Troublemaker, I know that I swapped Eve and Judy's roles. I think we should reveal our roles now to make things easier. I'll start by revealing that I'm the Troublemaker. Eve, Judy, you can reveal your roles now."
Judy talks: "Okay, since Frank has revealed that he's the Troublemaker, I'll reveal that I'm the Werewolf. Eve, you're the only one left, so you must be the Villager."
Eve talks: "Wait, what?! How could you two do this to me?! I thought we were friends! Fine, I'll just have to hope that the Troublemaker swapped our roles and that Judy is actually the Villager. Let's vote and see who gets lynched."
Frank talks: "Wait, Eve, don't vote yet. I have an idea. Since I'm the Troublemaker and I swapped your roles, that means Judy is actually the Villager and you're the Werewolf. Let's vote and see who gets lynched."
Judy talks: "Wait, what?! How could you do this to me, Frank?! I thought we were friends! Fine, I'll just have to hope that the Troublemaker swapped our roles and that Eve is actually the Villager. Let's vote and see who gets lynched."
Eve talks: "Wait, guys, I think we've been played. Frank, you're the Troublemaker, so you must have swapped our roles. That means Judy is actually the Werewolf and I'm the Villager. Let's vote and see who gets lynched."
Frank talks: "Wait, Eve, I think you're right. My apologies for the confusion, guys. I didn't mean to make things so complicated. Let's just vote and see who gets lynched."
Judy talks: "Wait, guys, can we just take a moment to think about this? We don't want to make a mistake and lynch an innocent person. Let's take a deep breath and think carefully before voting."
