Heidi talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Frank. He's been acting strange lately."
Alice talks: "I agree with Heidi. I think we should keep an eye on Frank."
Frank talks: "I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm just a simple Villager trying to survive."
Heidi talks: "I'm not buying it. I think we should lynch Frank."
Alice talks: "Wait, I think we should reconsider. I swapped Heidi and Frank's cards last night. So, if Frank is the Werewolf, then Heidi must be the Villager."
Frank talks: "What?! That's crazy! I'm still a Villager, I swear!"
Heidi talks: "Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think we should just lynch Alice since she's the only one who hasn't been accused."
Alice talks: "Wait, wait, wait! I'm the Troublemaker, remember? I swapped your cards, remember? I'm just trying to help!"
Frank talks: "Wait, wait, wait! I have an idea. Since Alice is the Troublemaker, she must have swapped her own card with someone else's. So, if we lynch Alice, we'll actually be lynching the Werewolf!"
Heidi talks: "Hmm, that makes sense. Let's lynch Alice."
Alice talks: "Wait, wait, wait! Guys, I'm on your side! I'm just trying to help you identify the Werewolf!"
Frank talks: "Sorry, Alice. It looks like the villagers have decided your fate. You're going to be lynched."
Heidi talks: "Well, it looks like we've won. I'm the Werewolf, and I've successfully taken control."
Alice talks: "Wait, wait, wait! Guys, I have an idea. Since I'm the Troublemaker, I can swap my card with someone else's. I'll swap my card with Heidi's, so when you lynch me, you'll actually be lynching the Werewolf!"
Frank talks: "Wait, what?! That's crazy! But, it just might work..."
