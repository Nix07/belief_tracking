Alice talks: "Hey guys, I think Charlie might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Judy?"
Charlie talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker. I swapped your cards last night, Alice and Judy. I don't know who's who now. But I do know that the Werewolf is one of you two."
Judy talks: "Hmm, interesting. Charlie, you're a Troublemaker, alright. But I don't think you're the Werewolf. Alice, I think you might be the Werewolf. You've been acting nervous and fidgety. Let's vote for Alice."
Alice talks: "Wait, what? No, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm a Villager. I think Judy might be the Werewolf. She's been acting suspiciously and avoiding direct answers. Charlie, what do you think?"
Charlie talks: "I'm not sure who to believe. But I do know that the Werewolf is trying to blend in and avoid suspicion. Let's not vote yet. We need more information."
Judy talks: "Okay, let's try to gather more information. Alice, can you tell me what you did last night? Maybe that'll help us figure out who the Werewolf is."
Alice talks: "Well, last night I... (pauses) Wait, I have an idea. Charlie, what if we test Judy's claim that she's not the Werewolf? We can ask her questions only the Werewolf would know the answer to. If she answers correctly, we'll know she's not the Werewolf. If she doesn't, we'll know she's hiding something."
Charlie talks: "That's a great idea, Alice. Judy, are you up for a little test?"
Judy talks: "Uh, sure. I have nothing to hide. But let's make it quick. I have a feeling the Werewolf might strike soon."
Alice talks: "Okay, here's the first question: What's the total number of players in this game?"
Charlie talks: "Alright, Judy. Let's hear your answer."
Judy talks: "Uh... (pauses) I think there are... (counts in her head) seven players in this game."
Alice talks: "Hmm, that's correct. But that doesn't prove much. Here's the second question: What's the name of the Troublemaker card?"
Charlie talks: "Alright, Judy. Let's hear your answer."
Judy talks: "Uh... (pauses) The Troublemaker card is called... (thinks for a moment) 'The Troublemaker'?"
