David talks: "Hey guys, I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think it's one of you two. I swapped your cards last night, so I'm not sure who's who now. Heidi, you seem nervous. Are you the Werewolf? Eve, you're usually pretty quiet, but you've been talking a lot today. Are you trying to distract us?"
Heidi talks: "David, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just worried because I don't know who to trust. Eve, what do you have to say for yourself? Why are you being so chatty today?"
Eve talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to figure out who it might be. David, why do you think it's one of us two? Have you noticed anything strange about our behavior?"
David talks: "Well, I did notice that Heidi seemed a bit too eager to vote off Eve. And Eve, you've been acting a bit too nonchalant for someone who's supposed to be worried about being eaten. I think one of you two might be trying to throw us off the scent."
Heidi talks: "David, I think you might be onto something. Eve, can you explain why you're so calm and collected?"
Eve talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to stay focused and figure out who the real culprit is. David, have you considered the fact that maybe the Werewolf is trying to make us doubt each other? Maybe we should take a closer look at the Troublemaker's role."
David talks: "Hmm, that's a good point, Eve. Maybe I should take a closer look at my own role. Troublemaker, huh? I wonder if I might have some special abilities that could help us out. Heidi, Eve, keep an eye on each other while I take a moment to think about this."
Heidi talks: "David, I think that's a good idea. Eve, I'll keep an eye on you just in case. David, do you have any ideas on how we can figure out who the Werewolf is?"
Eve talks: "Well, David, since you're the Troublemaker, maybe you can use your special abilities to help us out. Have you considered using your power to swap our roles again, just to mix things up and see if that helps us identify the Werewolf?"
David talks: "Hmm, that's not a bad idea, Eve. I'll use my Troublemaker power to swap your roles again. Maybe that'll shake things up and give us a better idea of who the Werewolf might be. Heidi, you're now the Villager. Eve, you're now the Troublemaker. Let's see if this changes anything."
Heidi talks: "Okay, I'm now the Villager. Eve, you're the Troublemaker. David, what do you think about this new development?"
Eve talks: "Well, David, now that I'm the Troublemaker, I can use my power to swap roles again and create even more confusion. But before I do that, let's think about who the Werewolf might be. Heidi, you seem like a pretty straightforward person, so I doubt you're the Werewolf. David, you've been acting a bit suspicious, but I think you might just be trying to throw us off the sc
David talks: "Thanks for the vote of confidence, Eve. I think we should use your Troublemaker power to swap roles again and see if that helps us out. Maybe we'll get lucky and the Werewolf will be revealed. Heidi, you're now the Troublemaker. Eve, you're now the Villager. Let's see if this helps us figure things out."
Heidi talks: "Okay, I'm now the Troublemaker. Eve, you're the Villager. David, what do you think about this new development?"
Eve talks: "Well, David, now that I'm the Villager, I have to say that I'm getting a bit suspicious of you. You've been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. I think it might be time for us to vote and see if we can eliminate the Werewolf once and for all."
