Grace talks: "Hey guys, I think Bob might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Judy?"
Judy talks: "Well, Grace, I think you might be the Werewolf. You've been acting suspicious and seem nervous. Bob, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Bob talks: "I'm not the Werewolf, guys. I'm just a little tired today. I think Judy might be the Werewolf. She's been acting weird and avoiding questions."
Grace talks: "I don't think that's true, Bob. Judy, can you explain yourself?"
Judy talks: "Well, Grace, I think you might be the Werewolf. You've been acting suspicious and seem nervous. Bob, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Bob talks: "I'm not the Werewolf, guys. I'm just a little tired today. I think Judy might be the Werewolf. She's been acting weird and avoiding questions."
Grace talks: "I don't think that's true, Bob. Judy, can you explain yourself?"
Judy talks: "Well, Grace, I think you might be the Werewolf. You've been acting suspicious and seem nervous. Bob, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Bob talks: "I'm not the Werewolf, guys. I'm just a little tired today. I think Judy might be the Werewolf. She's been acting weird and avoiding questions."
Grace talks: "I don't think that's true, Bob. Judy, can you explain yourself?"
Judy talks: "Guys, I have some information that might help us identify the Werewolf. During the night phase, I swapped your cards. So, Bob, you are now the Villager, and Grace, you are now the Werewolf."
Bob talks: "What?! That means I'm not the Werewolf! Grace, you must be the Werewolf then. Judy, you're the Troublemaker."
Grace talks: "Wait, what?! How could I be the Werewolf? I was just a Villager a moment ago! Judy, you must be the Werewolf."
Judy talks: "No, Grace, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker, remember? I swapped your cards to create confusion and help identify the Werewolf. Bob, you're the Villager now, and you must help me eliminate Grace, the Werewolf."
Bob talks: "Alright, Judy. I trust you. Let's eliminate Grace, the Werewolf."
