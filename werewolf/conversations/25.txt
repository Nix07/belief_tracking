Ivan talks: "Hey guys, I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think we can figure it out together. I swapped your cards last night, so we should be careful who we vote for. David, you've been acting strange. Are you the Werewolf?"
Grace talks: "Ivan, I think you might be the Werewolf. You're trying to deflect attention to David, but I'm not sure I believe you. David, what do you have to say for yourself?"
David talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I think Grace might be. She's trying to deflect attention to me, but I think she's just trying to hide her own identity. Ivan, have you noticed anything strange about Grace?"
Ivan talks: "Well, actually, I did notice that Grace seemed a bit nervous when we were discussing the Werewolf. Maybe she's trying to hide something. David, do you agree?"
Grace talks: "That's not true! I'm just trying to figure out who the Werewolf is, just like you guys. I think we should all take a closer look at Ivan. He's been awfully quiet and evasive when we've talked about the Werewolf. Maybe he's trying to hide something."
David talks: "Hmm, I'm not sure who to believe. Ivan, do you have anything to say for yourself?"
Ivan talks: "Well, I think we should all take a closer look at our own actions and words. Maybe the Werewolf is trying to manipulate us and make us doubt each other. Let's take a moment to think carefully before we make our final decision. Who do you guys think the Werewolf is?"
Grace talks: "I still think David might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. David, can you explain why you've been acting that way?"
David talks: (Note: David is the Werewolf, so he should try to deflect attention from himself and make the others doubt each other. He can use his five chances to speak to mislead the others and increase his chances of winning.)
Ivan talks: "Hmm, I'm still not sure who the Werewolf is. I think we should all take a closer look at our own actions and words. Maybe the Werewolf is trying to manipulate us and make us doubt each other. Let's take a moment to think carefully before we make our final decision. Who do you guys think the Werewolf is?"
Grace talks: "I still think David might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. David, can you explain why you've been acting that way?"
David talks: "I've been acting strange because I'm nervous about being accused of being the Werewolf. I don't want to be mistakenly voted for, especially since I'm not the Werewolf. I think we should all take a closer look at our own actions and words, like Ivan said. Maybe the Werewolf is trying to manipulate us and make us doubt each other. Who do you guys think the Werewolf is?"
Ivan talks: "Well, I think we've discussed enough. It's time to vote. Remember, we only have five chances to speak, so let's make our votes count. Who do you guys think the Werewolf is?"
Grace talks: "I still think David might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. David, can you explain why you've been acting that way?"
David talks: "I've been acting strange because I'm nervous about being accused of being the Werewolf. I don't want to be mistakenly voted for, especially since I'm not the Werewolf.
