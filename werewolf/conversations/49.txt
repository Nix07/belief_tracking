Judy talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful and not jump to conclusions. Let's discuss and vote carefully."
David talks: "I agree with Judy. I think we should take our time and not make any rash decisions. Let's hear everyone out and then decide."
Ivan talks: "I think we should be careful, but we shouldn't take too long either. We don't want the Werewolf to get away. Let's discuss and vote, but also be mindful of the time."
Judy talks: "Okay, let's hear each other out. David, what do you think? Who do you think might be the Werewolf?"
David talks: "Well, I think we should consider the fact that the Werewolf might be trying to blend in and not draw attention to themselves. Maybe someone who hasn't been very active in the discussion or has been avoiding suspicion."
Ivan talks: "That's a good point, David. I think we should also consider the fact that the Werewolf might be trying to manipulate us. Maybe someone who has been very active in the discussion and is trying to sway our opinions."
Judy talks: "Those are both good points. Ivan, what do you think? Who do you think might be the Werewolf?"
