Heidi talks: "Hey guys, I think David might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Bob?"
Bob talks: "Well, Heidi, I think you might be the Werewolf. You've been acting suspicious and avoiding eye contact too. David, what do you think?"
David talks: "I think Bob might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Heidi?"
Heidi talks: "I think David might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Bob?"
Bob talks: "Guys, I have a theory. I swapped your cards last night, so I know you're not the Werewolf. I think the Werewolf is the one who's been avoiding eye contact and acting strange. So, it must be David."
David talks: "Wait, what?! Bob, you're the Troublemaker! You're trying to confuse us. I think Bob might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Heidi?"
Heidi talks: "Hmm, I'm not sure. I think we should vote for Bob. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact, and David's accusations make me suspicious."
Bob talks: "Wait, no! Guys, I'm just trying to help. I swapped your cards to create confusion and help us identify the Werewolf. I'm not the Werewolf, I swear!"
David talks: "I don't know what to think. I think we should vote for Bob. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact, and Heidi's accusations make me suspicious."
Heidi talks: "Okay, let's vote. I vote for Bob."
Bob talks: "Wait, no! Guys, please. I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help."
David talks: "I vote for Bob too."
Heidi talks: "Well, it looks like Bob is the Werewolf. Let's eliminate him."
Bob talks: "No! Guys, I swear I'm not the Werewolf. I was just trying to help."
David talks: "Sorry, Bob. It looks like you're the Werewolf. We have to eliminate you."
