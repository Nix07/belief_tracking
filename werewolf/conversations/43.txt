Grace talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Alice. She's been acting strange lately."
Frank talks: "I agree with Grace. Alice, can you explain why you've been acting strange?"
Alice talks: "I'm not sure what you're talking about. I've been acting the same as always."
Grace talks: "I don't believe her. I think she's trying to hide something. Let's vote for Alice."
Frank talks: "Wait, I don't think we should jump to conclusions. Alice, can you give us any reason why we shouldn't vote for you?"
Alice talks: "Well, I did have a strange dream last night. In the dream, Grace was a werewolf and Frank was a villager. Maybe we should vote for Grace instead?"
Grace talks: "That's ridiculous! I'm not a werewolf. I think we should stick with our original plan and vote for Alice."
Frank talks: "I'm not sure what to think. I think we should give Alice a chance to explain herself further. Let's not vote yet."
Alice talks: "Thank you, Frank. I swear, I'm not a werewolf. I think we should discuss this further before making a decision."
Grace talks: "Fine, let's discuss this further. But I still think Alice is hiding something."
Frank talks: "Okay, let's summarize what we know. Alice has been acting strange, but she claims she's not a werewolf. We also have a dream that suggests Grace might be a werewolf. What do we do now?"
Alice talks: "I think we should take another look at our roles. Maybe there's something we missed. And let's not forget, the Troublemaker can also cause confusion. Maybe we should consider that as well."
Grace talks: "I agree. Let's take another look at our roles and see if we can find any clues. And let's not forget to keep an eye on each other, in case the Troublemaker tries to cause more confusion."
Frank talks: "Alright, let's do that. And remember, we only have five chances to speak with each other before we have to make a decision. Let's make sure we use them wisely."
Alice talks: "I think we should take another look at our roles. Maybe there's something we missed. And let's not forget, the Troublemaker can also cause confusion. Maybe we should consider that as well."
