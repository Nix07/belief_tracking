David says:  "Hello everyone, I'm David. I'm a Villager and my goal is to identify and eliminate the Werewolf among us. I'd like to start by asking a few questions to gather more information. Who among us has been a Villager in the previous game?"

Heidi says:  "I've been a Werewolf for a long time, and I've noticed that some of you seem suspicious. I think we should focus on identifying the real Werewolf among us. Let's discuss who we think it might be and why."

Ivan says:  "Good morning, everyone! Let's discuss who we think might be the Werewolf today. I'd like to remind everyone that we have five chances to speak with each other. Let's make them count!
