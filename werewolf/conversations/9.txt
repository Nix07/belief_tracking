Alice talks: "Hey guys, I think Charlie might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. Let's vote for him."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just nervous because I don't want to be eliminated. I think Grace might be the Werewolf. She's been hiding her face and avoiding discussions."
Grace talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker. During the night phase, I swapped your cards. So, Alice is now the Villager, and Charlie is the Werewolf. Let's vote for Charlie."
Alice talks: "What?! How could you do this to me, Grace? I thought we were friends. Okay, I guess I'll have to defend myself now. Charlie, I think you're the Werewolf. Let's vote for him."
Charlie talks: "Wait, what?! I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I think Grace is just trying to confuse us. Let's not vote for anyone yet. We need more information."
Grace talks: "Guys, I'm not trying to confuse you. I'm just trying to help identify the Werewolf. I know it's hard to believe, but trust me, I'm the Troublemaker. I've seen the cards, and I know who's who. Let's just vote for Charlie already."
Alice talks: "Hmm, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to vote for the wrong person. Charlie, can you give me any reason why we shouldn't vote for you?"
Charlie talks: "Well, Alice, I'm not sure what to say. I'm just a Villager, and I don't want to be eliminated. I think we should all just take a moment to think about this carefully before we vote. Maybe we can figure out a way to identify the Werewolf without just guessing blindly."
Grace talks: "I agree with Charlie. Let's take a moment to think. Maybe we can come up with a plan to identify the Werewolf for sure."
Alice talks: "Okay, I think I have an idea. Charlie, if you're really the Villager, then you should be able to tell us who the Werewolf is. If you're not the Werewolf, then you should be able to give us a hint about who it might be. So, Charlie, who do you think the Werewolf is?"
Charlie talks: "Hmm, that's a tough question. I'm not sure if I should say this, but... I think the Werewolf might be Grace. I know she's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. Plus, she's been trying to deflect attention from herself by accusing me. So, I think we should vote for Grace."
Grace talks: "What?! How could you, Charlie?! I'm the Troublemaker, remember? I swapped your cards. You're the Werewolf, and you're just trying to confuse us. Let's not fall for his tricks, guys. Let's vote for Charlie."
Alice talks: "Wait, what?! This is getting confusing. I don't know who to believe. Charlie, is Grace telling the truth? Are you really the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "No, Alice, I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I think Grace is just trying to confuse us. Let's not vote for anyone yet. We need more information."
Grace talks: "Guys, come on. Let's not waste any more time. We need to vote for the Werewolf before it's too late. Let's just vote for Charlie already."
