Judy talks: "Hey guys, I think Alice might be the Werewolf. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Ivan?"
Ivan talks: "Hmm, I'm not sure. I think it might be Judy. She's been talking a lot and trying to deflect attention from herself."
Alice talks: "Guys, I think we should consider the fact that we've all been acting strange. It's hard to identify the Werewolf without concrete evidence. Maybe we should look for inconsistencies in each other's stories or behavior."
Judy talks: "That's a good point, Alice. But I still think you're acting fishy. Ivan, what do you think?"
Ivan talks: "Well, Judy, I think we should consider the fact that you're the one who brought up Alice's name first. Maybe you're trying to deflect attention from yourself."
Alice talks: "Guys, I think we're getting nowhere with this. Let's try to focus on the facts. During the night phase, I swapped your cards, Judy and Ivan. Maybe that could give us a clue about who the Werewolf is."
Judy talks: "Hmm, that's interesting. Ivan, do you have any idea who might have swapped our cards?"
Ivan talks: "Well, Judy, I think it's possible that the Werewolf might have swapped our cards to create confusion. But I'm not sure who it could be."
Alice talks: "I see. Well, guys, I think we should keep discussing and try to find more clues. Maybe we can figure out who the Werewolf is by the end of the day."
Judy talks: "Alright, let's keep discussing. But remember, I'm still suspicious of Alice. Ivan, keep an eye on her."
Ivan talks: "Sure, Judy. I'll keep an eye on Alice. But let's not forget that we need to find concrete evidence to identify the Werewolf."
Alice talks: "Sure, guys. Let's keep discussing and see if we can find any more clues."
Judy talks: "Alright, let's vote. I vote for Alice. Ivan, who do you vote for?"
Ivan talks: "Well, Judy, I'm still not sure who the Werewolf is. But I think we should keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. Let's not vote yet. Maybe we can find more clues during the night phase."
Alice talks: "Thanks, Ivan. I think we should all take a closer look at our own behavior and see if we can find any inconsistencies. Maybe that will help us identify the Werewolf."
