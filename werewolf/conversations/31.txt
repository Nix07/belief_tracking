Grace talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Frank. He's been acting strange lately. Maybe he's the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "I agree with Grace. Frank has been acting strange. But we should also consider the fact that he's been trying to make us suspicious of him. Maybe he's trying to distract us from the real Werewolf."
Frank talks: "Guys, I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm just a simple Troublemaker trying to survive and help you identify the Werewolf. But I do have some information that might be helpful. During the night phase, I swapped your cards, Grace and Charlie. So, if either of you are the Werewolf, the other person should be the Villager. Just something to keep in mind."
Grace talks: "Thanks for the information, Frank. That's definitely helpful. But we still need to be careful. Charlie, do you have any thoughts on who the Werewolf might be?"
Charlie talks: "Well, Grace, I think we should consider the fact that Frank is trying to make us suspicious of him. Maybe he's trying to distract us from the real Werewolf. But at the same time, we can't rule out the possibility that he's telling the truth and is actually the Villager. It's a tough decision, but I think we should keep an open mind and observe everyone's behavior closely."
Frank talks: "I agree with Charlie. We should keep an open mind and observe everyone's behavior. But I have to say, I'm getting a bit nervous. I don't want to be wrongly accused of being the Werewolf. Maybe we should discuss some more and see if we can come up with a plan to identify the real Werewolf."
Grace talks: "I think that's a good idea, Frank. Let's discuss some more and see if we can come up with a plan. Maybe we can come up with a list of suspects and narrow it down from there."
Charlie talks: "Sounds good to me. Let's discuss some more and see if we can come up with a plan to identify the real Werewolf."
Frank talks: "Alright, let's do it. But remember, I'm just a simple Troublemaker trying to survive and help you identify the Werewolf. So, let's work together and see if we can figure this out."
Grace talks: "Alright, let's summarize what we know. We know that Frank swapped our cards during the night phase, so if either of us are the Werewolf, the other person should be the Villager. We also know that Frank is trying to make us suspicious of him, but we can't rule out the possibility that he's telling the truth and is actually the Villager. We should keep an open mind and observe everyone's behavior closely. Does
