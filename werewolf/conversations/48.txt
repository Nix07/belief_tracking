David talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Frank. He's been acting strange lately. I think he might be the Werewolf."
Heidi talks: "David, I agree with you. I think we should definitely keep an eye on Frank. But, I have a feeling that David might be the Werewolf. I mean, he's been awfully quiet and secretive lately."
Frank talks: "Guys, I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm definitely not the Werewolf. I think we should focus on finding the real Werewolf, not accusing each other."
David talks: "I agree with Frank. We should focus on finding the real Werewolf. But, I still have my doubts about Frank. I think we should keep a close eye on him."
Heidi talks: "I understand your concerns, David. But, I think we should also consider the fact that Frank has been acting strange lately. Maybe he's just trying to throw us off his scent. I think we should keep a close eye on both Frank and David."
Frank talks: "Guys, I appreciate your concerns. But, I assure you that I'm not the Werewolf. I think we should trust each other and work together to find the real Werewolf. Let's not accuse each other without solid evidence."
David talks: "I understand what you're saying, Frank. But, I still have my doubts. I think we should keep discussing and gathering more information before we make our final decision."
Heidi talks: "I agree with David. Let's keep discussing and gathering more information. Maybe we'll find something that will help us identify the real Werewolf."
Frank talks: "Guys, I think we've discussed enough. It's time to vote. I propose we vote for David. He's been acting strange lately, and I think he might be the Werewolf."
David talks: "What?! Why would you suggest voting for me? I'm a Villager, just like you! I think we should vote for Frank. He's been acting strange, and he's the only one who hasn't been accused yet."
Heidi talks: "Guys, I think we should take a closer look at our cards before we vote. Maybe there's something there that will help us identify the real Werewolf."
Frank talks: "I agree with Heidi. Let's take a closer look at our cards before we vote. Maybe we'll find something that will help us identify the real Werewolf."
David talks: "Okay, let's take a closer look at our cards. Hmm... wait a minute. I think I see something. It looks like Frank has a Werewolf card! Guys, I think we've found our Werewolf!"
Heidi talks: "Wait, what?! How could that be? I swapped your cards during the night phase, David. That means you must be the Werewolf! Guys, I think we've found our Werewolf!"
Frank talks: "What?! How could you do that, Heidi?! I thought we were working together to find the real Werewolf! Now, I'm the one who's been accused!"
