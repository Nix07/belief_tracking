Grace talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with our votes. We don't want to accuse the wrong person. Let's see if we can figure out who the Werewolf is based on our roles."
Charlie talks: "I agree. I think we should share our roles to help identify the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker, and I swapped Grace and Heidi's cards last night. So, Grace, you're now a Villager, and Heidi, you're a Werewolf."
Heidi talks: "Wait, what? I'm the Werewolf now? That's not fair! I was a Villager all along."
Grace talks: "Heidi, I think you're telling the truth. Charlie, why would you swap our cards? You're the Troublemaker, you could be helping the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "I swapped your cards to create confusion and help identify the Werewolf. I'm not helping anyone. I want to win this game too."
Heidi talks: "I don't know what to say. I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. Maybe we should vote for Charlie since he's the Troublemaker and could be helping the Werewolf."
Grace talks: "I'm not sure. Charlie, do you have any explanation for your actions?"
Charlie talks: "I swapped your cards to create confusion and help identify the Werewolf. I'm not helping anyone. I want to win this game too."
Heidi talks: "I think we should vote for Charlie. He's the Troublemaker and could be helping the Werewolf."
Grace talks: "Okay, let's vote. I'll start. I vote for Charlie."
Charlie talks: "Wait, wait, wait. I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just the Troublemaker. You guys are making a mistake."
Heidi talks: "It's too late for that, Charlie. The vote has already started. I vote for Charlie too."
Grace talks: "The vote is tied between Charlie and Heidi. We need to discuss more."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm telling you, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help. Maybe we should vote for Heidi since she's been acting suspicious."
Heidi talks: "What? No, that's not fair. I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. Maybe we should vote for Grace since she's been quiet this whole time."
