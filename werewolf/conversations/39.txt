Frank talks: "Hey guys, I think David might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Heidi?"
Heidi talks: "I don't know, Frank. I think you might be the Werewolf. You're always trying to deflect attention from yourself."
David talks: "Guys, I think we should consider the fact that we've all been acting strange. It's like we're all trying to hide something. Maybe we should look for inconsistencies in our stories."
Frank talks: "That's a good point, David. But I still think you're the Werewolf. Let's put it to a vote."
Heidi talks: "Wait, I have an idea. Let's not vote yet. Instead, let's try to gather more information. We can ask each other questions to clear up any inconsistencies in our stories. Maybe that'll help us identify the Werewolf."
David talks: "That's a great idea, Heidi. I'll start. Frank, can you tell me what you were doing last night when the Troublemaker swapped our cards?"
Frank talks: "Uh, well...I was asleep. Yeah, that's it. I was asleep and didn't notice anything unusual."
Heidi talks: "Hmm, that's strange. David, can you tell me what you were doing last night when the Troublemaker swapped our cards?"
David talks: "Well, Heidi, I was definitely awake and aware of what was happening. In fact, I was the one who swapped your and Frank's cards. I'm the Troublemaker!"
Frank talks: "What?! That's not possible! You're just trying to deflect attention from yourself, David!"
Heidi talks: "Wait, wait, wait. This is getting interesting. David, if you're the Troublemaker, then who did you swap me with?"
David talks: "Ah, that's the best part. I swapped you, Heidi, with...Frank! That's right, Frank is now the Villager, and you're the Werewolf!"
Frank talks: "What?! No way! This is ridiculous! I'm not the Werewolf, I swear!"
Heidi talks: "Well, well, well. It looks like we have a lot to think about. Let's take another look at our cards and see if we can figure out who the real Werewolf is."
David talks: "I'm glad you guys are taking this seriously. As the Troublemaker, my goal is to create confusion and help you identify the Werewolf. Let's keep discussing and see if we can come to a consensus."
