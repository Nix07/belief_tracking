Heidi talks: "Guys, I think we should be careful with David. He's been acting strange lately. I think he might be the Werewolf."
Ivan talks: "I agree with Heidi. David has been acting strange. I think we should keep an eye on him."
David talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker. I swapped your cards last night. Ivan, you are now the Werewolf, and Heidi, you are the Villager."
Heidi talks: "Oh, I see. I think we should still keep an eye on David. He might be trying to distract us."
Ivan talks: "I don't think David is the Werewolf. He's just trying to confuse us. I think we should focus on finding the real Werewolf."
David talks: "Guys, come on. I'm telling you, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help you identify the real one. Ivan, you've been acting strange too. Maybe you're the Werewolf."
Heidi talks: "I don't know what to think. I'm confused. Maybe we should just vote and see who gets eliminated."
Ivan talks: "I think we should vote for David. He's been acting strange, and he's been trying to distract us."
David talks: "Guys, please. I'm not the Werewolf. Don't vote for me."
Heidi talks: "I'm going to vote for David. I think he's the Werewolf."
Ivan talks: "I'm going to vote for David too. I think he's trying to distract us."
David talks: "No, no, no. Guys, please. I'm not the Werewolf. You're making a mistake."
Heidi talks: "It's too late now. The vote has been cast, and David has been eliminated. Let's see what his card says."
Ivan talks: "Oh, I see. David was the Troublemaker. That means I'm the Werewolf."
David talks: "I can't believe you guys didn't believe me. I was just trying to help you identify the real Werewolf."
