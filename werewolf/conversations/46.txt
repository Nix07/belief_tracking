Frank talks: "Hey guys, I think we should look for the Troublemaker first. If we can eliminate the Troublemaker, we can focus on finding the Werewolf."
Grace talks: "I agree with Frank. Let's first identify the Troublemaker and then we can focus on the Werewolf."
Judy talks: "I think we should be careful with our accusations. We don't want to accuse the wrong person and give the Werewolf an advantage. Let's discuss and debate carefully."
Frank talks: "I agree with Judy. We should be careful and strategic in our accusations. Let's not jump to conclusions."
Grace talks: "I think we should take a vote now. Who do you guys think is the Troublemaker?"
Judy talks: "I think we should take a vote, but before that, I have some information to share. During the night phase, I swapped Frank and Grace's cards. So, their roles are now swapped. Just thought you should know."
Frank talks: "What?! That's not fair! I was the Werewolf and now you've swapped our roles?!"
Grace talks: "Wait, what?! This changes everything. Now, I think we should re-evaluate our strategy."
Judy talks: "As a Troublemaker, my goal is to create confusion and help identify the Werewolf. I've done my part by swapping your roles. Now, it's up to you guys to figure out who the Werewolf is."
Frank talks: "Okay, let's take a vote. Who do you guys think is the Werewolf now?"
Grace talks: "I think we should take a closer look at Judy. She seems a bit too calm and collected for someone who's been accused of being the Troublemaker."
Judy talks: "I understand your concerns, Grace. But, as a Troublemaker, my goal is to create confusion and help identify the Werewolf. I've done my part by swapping your roles. Now, it's up to you guys to figure out who the Werewolf is."
Frank talks: "I agree with Grace. Let's take a vote. Who do you guys think is the Werewolf now?"
Grace talks: "Before we take a vote, I want to point out that Judy seems a bit too calm and collected for someone who's been accused of being the Troublemaker. I think we should consider her as a potential Werewolf."
Judy talks: "I understand your concerns, Grace. But, as a Troublemaker, my goal is to create confusion and help identify the Werewolf. I've done my part by swapping your roles. Now, it's up to you guys to figure out who the Werewolf is."
