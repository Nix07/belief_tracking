Eve talks: "Friends, I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I have a plan. Since I'm the Troublemaker, I swapped Charlie and Alice's cards last night. So, Charlie, you might be the Werewolf, or Alice might be. I'm not sure, but I'm hoping one of you will reveal your true identity. Charlie, you seem nervous. Are you the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "Eve, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm a Villager. I don't know who the Werewolf is, but I'm sure it's not me. Alice, what do you think? Do you have any suspicions?"
Alice talks: "Well, Charlie, I think you might be the Werewolf. You seem too nervous, and Eve's plan has made me suspicious of you. I'm not sure, though. Eve, what do you think?"
Eve talks: "Alice, I'm glad you're suspicious of Charlie. I'm still not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think it's between Charlie and Alice. Charlie, you seem more nervous now. Are you sure you're not the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "Eve, I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I don't know who it is, but I'm not it. Alice, I think you might be the Werewolf. You seem a bit too quick to suspect me, and Eve's plan might have been a diversion. What do you think, Eve?"
Alice talks: "Well, Charlie, I think you might be telling the truth. I'm still not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think it's between you and Eve. Eve, what's your final verdict?"
Eve talks: "Friends, I'm still not sure who the Werewolf is. I think it's between Charlie and Alice. I'll vote for Charlie, but I'm still not sure. Let's see how the vote goes."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I don't know who it is, but I'm not it. Please, don't vote for me."
Alice talks: "Well, Charlie, it seems like we're at a stalemate. I'm still not sure who the Werewolf is, but I'll vote for Eve. Maybe she'll reveal her true identity."
Eve talks: "Friends, it seems like we've reached a stalemate. Let's vote and see who gets eliminated. I'll vote for Charlie, but I'm still not sure who the Werewolf is."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I don't know who it is, but I'm not it. Please, don't vote for me."
