Ivan talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Frank. He's been acting strange lately. I think he might be the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "Ivan, I think you might be onto something. I swapped your cards with Frank's last night, and now I'm not sure who's who. I think we should keep a close eye on both of you."
Frank talks: "Guys, I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm definitely not the Werewolf. I think we should focus on finding the real Werewolf."
Ivan talks: "I'm not sure I believe you, Frank. I think we should vote for you."
Charlie talks: "Ivan, I think we should hold off on voting for now. I have a feeling that the Werewolf might be trying to manipulate us. Let's keep discussing and see if we can gather more information."
Frank talks: "I appreciate your hesitation, Charlie. I think we should keep discussing and see if we can figure out who the Werewolf is. Maybe we can get some clues from each other's behavior."
Ivan talks: "Okay, let's keep discussing. But I'm still suspicious of Frank. I think we should keep a close eye on him."
Charlie talks: "I understand your concerns, Ivan. But let's not jump to conclusions. We need to be strategic about this. I think we should all try to act normal and see if we can get any information from each other's behavior. Maybe the Werewolf will slip up and reveal themselves."
Frank talks: "I agree with Charlie. Let's try to act normal and see if we can catch the Werewolf off guard. Maybe we can get some clues from their behavior."
Ivan talks: "Okay, I'll try to act normal. But I'm still suspicious of Frank. I think we should keep a close eye on him."
Charlie talks: "I understand, Ivan. But let's not be too quick to judge. We need to be strategic about this. Let's keep discussing and see if we can gather more information."
