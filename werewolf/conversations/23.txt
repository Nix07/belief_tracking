Charlie talks: "Hey guys, I'm Troublemaker. I swapped your cards last night. I don't know who's who now. But I think Heidi might be the Werewolf. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Eve?"
Eve talks: "Hmm, I'm not sure. I think Charlie might be the Werewolf. He's been talking a lot and trying to deflect attention from himself. What do you think, Heidi?"
Heidi talks: "I don't know what to think. I'm just a Villager trying to survive. I think we should lynch Charlie. He's been acting suspicious and seems to be trying to manipulate us."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I'm just trying to help. I think we should lynch Heidi. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact like I said before."
Eve talks: "I agree with Charlie. I think we should lynch Heidi. She seems suspicious."
Heidi talks: "Wait, guys. I think we should reconsider. I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just a Villager trying to survive. Maybe we should lynch Eve instead. She's been quiet and not contributing much to the discussion."
Charlie talks: "I don't know, guys. I'm getting confused. I think we should lynch Eve. She's been quiet and not contributing much to the discussion like Heidi said."
Eve talks: "Wait, what? Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just a Villager trying to survive like Heidi. I think we should lynch Charlie. He's been acting suspicious and trying to manipulate us."
Heidi talks: "I agree with Eve. I think we should lynch Charlie. He's been acting suspicious and trying to manipulate us."
Charlie talks: "Wait, guys. I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I'm just trying to help. Maybe we should lynch ourselves to see who the Werewolf really is."
Eve talks: "Wait, what? Charlie, are you insane? We can't lynch ourselves. That's not how the game works."
Heidi talks: "I think we should lynch Charlie. He's been acting suspicious and trying to manipulate us. And Eve, I think you might be the Werewolf. You've been quiet and not contributing much to the discussion."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I'm just trying to help. Maybe we should lynch ourselves to see who the Werewolf really is."
Eve talks: "Wait, what? Charlie, are you insane? We can't lynch ourselves. That's not how the game works. I think we should lynch Heidi. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact like you said before, Charlie."
Heidi talks: "Wait, guys. I think we should reconsider. I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just a Villager trying to survive. Maybe we should lynch Eve instead. She's been quiet and not contributing much to the discussion."
