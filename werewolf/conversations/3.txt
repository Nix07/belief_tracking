Judy talks: "Hey guys, I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think it's one of you two. I swapped your cards last night, so I'm not sure who's who anymore. I think we should all share some information to figure out who the Werewolf is. Frank, what do you think? Have you noticed anything strange?"
Frank talks: "Well, I'm not sure. I think Eve might be the Werewolf. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Eve?"
Eve talks: "I'm not sure. I think Frank might be the Werewolf. He's been acting nervous and fidgety. But I could be wrong. Maybe Judy is the Werewolf. She's been awfully quiet and not contributing much to the conversation. What do you guys think?"
Judy talks: "Hmm, that's interesting. I think we should all take a closer look at each other's actions and behavior. Frank, can you think of anything that might clear your name? Eve, can you explain why you've been avoiding eye contact?"
Frank talks: "Well, I've been feeling a bit nervous because I don't want to be wrongly accused. Maybe that's why I've been fidgety. But I swear, I'm not the Werewolf!"
Eve talks: "I've been avoiding eye contact because I don't want to give away my true identity. But I assure you, I'm not the Werewolf. Maybe we should all just vote and see who gets the most votes?"
Judy talks: "That's not a bad idea. But before we vote, let me ask you guys something. Have either of you noticed anything strange about the other player's behavior or actions? Anything that might indicate they're the Werewolf?"
Frank talks: "Well, now that you mention it, Eve did seem a bit too eager to suggest voting. Maybe she's trying to rush the process and avoid further scrutiny?"
Eve talks: "That's not true! I just want to get this over with and find out who the Werewolf is. Besides, Frank, you're the one who's been acting nervous and fidgety. Maybe you're trying to distract us from your own guilt?"
Judy talks: "Hmm, this is getting interesting. I think we might be getting close to identifying the Werewolf. Let's summarize what we know so far. Frank, you've been acting nervous and fidgety, and Eve, you've been avoiding eye contact and seem eager to rush the voting process. Who do you guys think the Werewolf is now?"
Frank talks: "Well, I still think Eve might be the Werewolf. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. But I could be wrong. Maybe Judy is the Werewolf. She's been awfully quiet and not contributing much to the conversation. What do you guys think?"
Eve talks: "I still think Frank might be the Werewolf. He's been acting nervous and fidgety, and his excuse for not looking at us doesn't convince me. But I could be wrong. Maybe Judy is the Werewolf. She's been awfully quiet and not contributing much to the conversation. What do you guys think?"
Judy talks: "Well, it seems like we're all still unsure about who the Werewolf is. I think we should all just vote and see who gets the most votes. Who's with me?"
Frank talks: "I'm with you, Judy. Let's just vote and get this over with."
Eve talks: "Fine, let's vote. But I'm warning you, I'm not going down without a fight!"
