Charlie talks: "Hey guys, I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think it's one of you two. David, you've been acting strange, and Judy, you've been avoiding eye contact. I think one of you might be the Werewolf."
David talks: "I'm not the Werewolf, I swear. I'm just nervous because I don't want to be wrongly accused. Judy, what do you think? Do you have any suspicions?"
Judy talks: "Well, I'm not sure. I think we should consider David's nervousness as a sign of innocence. Maybe the Werewolf is trying to throw us off by acting suspicious. Charlie, have you noticed anything else unusual about David's behavior?"
Charlie talks: "Now that you mention it, David, you did seem pretty eager to defend yourself. Maybe you're trying to hide something. Judy, what do you think?"
David talks: "Guys, come on. I'm telling you, I'm not the Werewolf. Maybe we should focus on finding the real culprit. Judy, do you have any ideas?"
Judy talks: "Well, Charlie did bring up a good point about David's defensiveness. But, I also noticed that Charlie has been avoiding eye contact with me. Maybe he's trying to hide something. What do you think, David?"
Charlie talks: "Okay, okay. I think we've had enough discussion. Let's vote. I vote for David."
David talks: "Wait, wait. Can't we discuss a bit more? I'm not the Werewolf, I swear."
Judy talks: "Sorry, David. I think we've made our decision. I vote for David as well."
Charlie talks: "Alright, it's settled then. David, you're out. Let's see your card."
David talks: "Fine. Here, take a look."
Judy talks: "Oh, I knew it! David, you sly Werewolf, you!"
Charlie talks: "Haha, gotcha! I knew it was one of you two. Well played, Judy. Well played."
David talks: "Well, I guess I didn't fool anyone with my acting. Maybe next time."
Judy talks: "Hey, guys. I think we should discuss a bit more before voting. We don't want to make the same mistake again."
