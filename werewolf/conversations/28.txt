Charlie talks: "Hey guys, I think Bob might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. Let's vote him out."
Bob talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker. I swapped Charlie and Eve's cards last night. So, Charlie, you might be the Werewolf."
Eve talks: "Wait, what? I don't think either of you are telling the truth. Charlie, you seem nervous. Bob, you're not convincing. Let's give it a little more thought before we vote."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm telling you, Bob is the Werewolf. He's trying to confuse us with his Troublemaker role. Let's not fall for it."
Bob talks: "I'm not trying to confuse you, Charlie. I'm just telling you what happened. You're the one who's nervous and avoiding eye contact. Maybe you're the Werewolf."
Eve talks: "Okay, let me think. Charlie, you seem suspicious, but Bob's story checks out. I think we should vote for Charlie."
Charlie talks: "Wait, no! Guys, listen. I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Villager. Bob's trying to manipulate us. Don't fall for it."
Bob talks: "I'm not manipulating you, Charlie. I'm just telling the truth. You're the one who's been acting strange."
Eve talks: "Okay, I've heard enough. It's time to vote. I'll vote for Charlie."
Charlie talks: "No, no, no! Guys, please. I'm not the Werewolf. Don't do this."
Bob talks: "Sorry, Charlie. It looks like you're outnumbered. Eve and I are voting for you."
Eve talks: "It's settled then. Charlie, you're out of the game. Bob, you're the Troublemaker. And I'm the last Villager standing. Let's see what happens next."
Charlie talks: "Wait, what? No, no, no! This can't be happening. Guys, I swear, I'm not the Werewolf. This is a mistake."
Bob talks: "Sorry, Charlie. It looks like you've been eliminated. Eve, it's just you and me now. Let's see what happens next."
Eve talks: "Okay, let's continue. Bob, as the Troublemaker, you have the power to swap our roles again tonight. Who do you choose to swap with?"
