Frank talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with each other. We don't know who the Werewolf is yet. Let's not jump to conclusions."
Ivan talks: "I agree with Frank. We should be careful. I think we should look for inconsistencies in each other's stories. That might help us identify the Werewolf."
Grace talks: "I agree with both of you. We should be careful and look for inconsistencies. But we should also be mindful of our own actions and stories. We don't want to give away our roles to the Werewolf."
Frank talks: "That's a good point, Grace. So, Ivan, what do you think we should do next?"
Ivan talks: "Well, I think we should continue to discuss and observe each other's behavior. Maybe we can catch the Werewolf off guard and expose them."
Grace talks: "I agree. Let's keep discussing and observing. But we should also be prepared to defend ourselves if we're accused of being the Werewolf."
Frank talks: "Definitely. So, Grace, have you noticed anything suspicious about Ivan's behavior?"
Ivan talks: "Actually, I have a theory. I think Frank might be the Werewolf. He's been acting a bit suspiciously, and he's been avoiding eye contact with me."
Grace talks: "Hmm, that's interesting. Frank, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Frank talks: (Note: As a Villager, Frank's goal is to identify and eliminate the Werewolf without getting caught. He should speak in a way that doesn't reveal his true role, but still helps to achieve his goal.)
Ivan talks: "I think we should take Frank's avoidance of eye contact as a sign that he might be the Werewolf. Let's vote him out."
Grace talks: "Wait, I think we should reconsider. We don't have enough information to make a decision yet. Let's give Frank a chance to defend himself."
Frank talks: "Thank you, Grace. I assure you, I'm not the Werewolf. I've been avoiding eye contact because I'm nervous about being accused. I think we should continue to discuss and observe each other's behavior before making any rash decisions."
Ivan talks: "I understand what you're saying, Frank. But I still have my doubts. I think we should keep a close eye on him."
Grace talks: "I agree with Ivan. We should keep observing Frank's behavior. But we should also be mindful of our own actions and stories. We don't want to give away our roles to the Werewolf."
