Heidi talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Charlie. He's been acting strange lately. I think he might be the Werewolf."
Grace talks: "I agree with Heidi. Charlie has been acting strange. But I think we should also consider the fact that Heidi has been acting strange too. Maybe she's trying to distract us from the real Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker. I swapped your cards last night, so you can't trust what you think you know. I think we should look for the Werewolf among the people who have been acting normal and not drawing attention to themselves."
Heidi talks: "Hmm, that's a good point Charlie. But I still think you're the Werewolf. Let's vote and see who gets eliminated."
Grace talks: "Wait, I think we should consider the fact that Charlie is trying to distract us from the real Werewolf. Maybe we should vote for Heidi instead."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I'm telling you, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help you identify the real Werewolf. Let's not vote yet. Let's discuss some more."
Heidi talks: "Okay, let's discuss some more. But I still think Charlie is the Werewolf."
Grace talks: "Okay, let's discuss some more. But I still think Charlie is the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "Guys, I understand that you're suspicious of me, but I'm really not the Werewolf. I think we should look for the Werewolf among the people who have been acting normal and not drawing attention to themselves. Maybe we should vote for Grace instead."
