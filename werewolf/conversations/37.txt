Grace talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Judy. She's been acting strange lately."
Frank talks: "I agree with Grace. Judy has been avoiding eye contact and seems nervous."
Judy talks: "Guys, I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm just trying to enjoy the game."
Grace talks: "I'm not buying it. I think Judy is the Werewolf."
Frank talks: "I'm not sure about Judy. I think we should consider other options."
Judy talks: "I understand your concerns, but I assure you I'm not the Werewolf. Let's discuss other possibilities."
Grace talks: "Okay, let's consider Frank. He's been acting suspiciously and seems overly defensive of Judy."
Frank talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help us identify the real culprit. Let's not jump to conclusions."
Judy talks: "I agree with Frank. We should keep an open mind and not make assumptions based on limited information."
Grace talks: "I understand, but I still have my doubts about Judy. Let's put it to a vote."
Frank talks: "Before we vote, I want to share some information. As the Troublemaker, I swapped Grace and Judy's cards during the night phase. This means their roles are now reversed. Judy is now the Villager, and Grace is the Werewolf."
Judy talks: "What?! That changes everything. Now that we know Grace is the Werewolf, we should eliminate her."
Grace talks: "Wait, what?! How could you guys believe Frank's lies? I'm still the Villager!"
Frank talks: "Sorry, Grace. It's nothing personal. We have to eliminate the Werewolf to win the game."
Judy talks: "Guys, I think we've got this. Let's vote to eliminate Grace and win the game."
