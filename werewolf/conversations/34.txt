Heidi talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with each other. We don't know who the Werewolf is yet. Let's not jump to conclusions."
Frank talks: "I agree. I think we should take our time to observe each other's behavior and try to figure out who might be the Werewolf."
Ivan talks: "I think we should listen to each other's words and watch each other's actions. The Werewolf might accidentally reveal themselves."
Heidi talks: "That's a good point, Ivan. But we should also be careful not to make assumptions too quickly. We don't want to accuse an innocent person."
Frank talks: "I think we should take a closer look at Ivan's words. He said 'the Werewolf might accidentally reveal themselves.' That sounds like he's trying to deflect attention from himself. Maybe Ivan is the Werewolf?"
Ivan talks: "What? No, I'm not the Werewolf! I was just making an observation. You're the one who's trying to deflect attention, Frank. Maybe you're the Werewolf?"
Heidi talks: "Wait, let's not get too caught up in our own theories. We need more information before we make any accusations. Let's keep observing and discussing."
Frank talks: "I agree. But I still think Ivan's behavior is suspicious. I'm going to keep an eye on him."
Ivan talks: "Fine, I'll do the same with you, Frank. And Heidi, can you please clarify what you meant by 'behavior'? Are you looking for something specific?"
Heidi talks: "Well, I was thinking that the Werewolf might show some unusual behavior, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting. But now that I think about it, that could also be a trick to throw us off. Never mind, let's just keep discussing and see if we can catch any inconsistencies in each other's words."
Frank talks: "I think we should take a closer look at Heidi's words. She mentioned that the Werewolf might show unusual behavior, but then quickly dismissed it. Maybe she's trying to distract us from her own behavior? Maybe Heidi is the Werewolf?"
Ivan talks: "Hey, that's not fair, Frank! You're just trying to shift the attention to Heidi. I think we should focus on observing each other's actions and words, like Heidi suggested."
Heidi talks: "Thank you, Ivan. I think we're getting a bit carried away with our theories. Let's take a break and come back to this discussion later. We still have plenty of time before nightfall."
Frank talks: "Alright, let's take a break. But I'm still keeping an eye on both of you."
Ivan talks: "Sounds good. Let's reconvene later and see if we can gather more information."
