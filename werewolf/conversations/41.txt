Charlie talks: "Hey guys, I think Bob might be the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Ivan?"
Ivan talks: "I'm not sure. I think it's too early to make any accusations. Let's see what Bob has to say."
Bob talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Troublemaker. I swapped your cards last night, so Charlie is now the Villager and Ivan is the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "What?! That means Bob is telling the truth and Ivan is the Werewolf. Let's vote for Ivan."
Ivan talks: "Wait, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm the Villager. Bob is trying to frame me. Don't believe him."
Bob talks: "I swear, I'm telling the truth. I swapped your cards, Ivan. You're the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "This is getting confusing. I think we should vote for Bob. He's been acting suspicious and seems to be enjoying this too much."
Ivan talks: "Wait, Charlie. If we vote for Bob, and he's the Troublemaker, he'll just swap our cards again and we'll be back at square one. We need to vote for the real Werewolf."
Bob talks: "You guys are falling for my trap. I'm the Troublemaker, remember? I'm just trying to confuse you. Don't vote for me, vote for the real Werewolf - Ivan."
Charlie talks: "I'm confused. Who should we vote for?"
Ivan talks: "Charlie, trust me. I'm the Villager. Let's vote for Bob. He's been acting strange and seems to be enjoying this too much. He must be the Werewolf."
Bob talks: "Ha! You guys fell for my trap. I'm the Troublemaker, and I've successfully confused you. You've voted for me, and now I get to swap your cards again. Good game, guys!"
Charlie talks: "Wait, what?! No, that can't be. We were so close to winning."
Ivan talks: "Well played, Bob. You got us good. Let's play again sometime."
Bob talks: "Definitely. I'll make sure to shuffle the cards better next time. Good game, guys!"
