Charlie talks: "Hey guys, I'm Troublemaker. I swapped your cards last night. I don't know who's who now. But I think Alice might be the Werewolf. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. What do you think, Grace?"
Alice talks: "I'm not the Werewolf! I'm just nervous because I don't know who to trust. Charlie, why do you suspect me? Have you noticed something I haven't?"
Grace talks: "Well, Charlie, Alice, I think we should consider the fact that Charlie is the Troublemaker. He could be trying to mislead us. I mean, why would Alice avoid eye contact if she were the Werewolf? It doesn't make sense. I think we should look closer at Charlie's behavior."
Charlie talks: "That's a good point, Grace. But, I'm just trying to help. I don't want the Werewolf to win. I'm not sure about you, Grace, but Alice seems suspicious. Maybe we should vote for her?"
Alice talks: "Wait, wait, wait! I'm not the Werewolf! I'm just a Villager trying to survive. Charlie, why are you so set on me being the Werewolf? Have you noticed something I haven't?"
Grace talks: "Okay, let's slow down. Charlie, why don't you explain why you chose to swap our cards last night? And Alice, can you give us any reason why Charlie might be the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "Well, I swapped your cards to create confusion and help us identify the Werewolf. And Alice, I don't have any reason to suspect you, but I thought you were acting strange. Maybe I was wrong. As for Grace, I don't think you're the Werewolf either. But, I'm not sure who to trust. Maybe we should vote for Alice, just to be safe?"
Alice talks: "I understand that you want to be safe, Charlie, but I'm not the Werewolf. I think we should consider the fact that Charlie is the Troublemaker. He could be trying to mislead us. And, Charlie, why would I be the Werewolf? I have no reason to want to eliminate anyone. Let's think about this logically and not just follow our gut feelings."
Grace talks: "Okay, I think we've discussed enough. It's time to vote. Who do you guys think we should vote for?"
Charlie talks: "I still think we should vote for Alice. I don't want to take any chances with the Werewolf."
Alice talks: "I understand that you want to be safe, Charlie, but I'm not the Werewolf. I think we should consider the fact that Charlie is the Troublemaker. He could be trying to mislead us. And, Charlie, why would I be the Werewolf? I have no reason to want to eliminate anyone. Let's think about this logically and not just follow our gut feelings."
