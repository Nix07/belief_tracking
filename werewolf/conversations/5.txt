Heidi talks: "Hey guys, I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think we can figure it out together. I swapped your cards last night, so Charlie, you're now a Villager, and Frank, you're a Werewolf. Charlie, you've been acting strange, avoiding eye contact. Are you the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just nervous because I don't want to be wrongly accused. I think Frank is the Werewolf. He's been acting suspicious, always looking around and whispering to himself."
Frank talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to figure out who it could be. Charlie, you're acting strange, and Heidi, you're the Troublemaker. You're trying to confuse us. I think Heidi is the Werewolf."
Heidi talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I swapped your cards, remember? I'm just trying to help. Charlie, why are you so nervous? Maybe you're the Werewolf and you're trying to hide it."
Charlie talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I swear. I'm just worried that I'll get accused. I think we should look at Frank's behavior. He's been acting weird."
Frank talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to figure out who it could be. Charlie, you're acting strange, and Heidi, you're the Troublemaker. You're trying to confuse us. I think Heidi is the Werewolf."
Heidi talks: "Okay, let's sum it up. Charlie thinks Frank is the Werewolf. Frank thinks I'm the Werewolf. I think Charlie is the Werewolf. Who do you guys think is the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "I still think Frank is the Werewolf. He's been acting suspicious, and he's trying to blame me."
Frank talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to figure out who it could be. Charlie, you're acting strange, and Heidi, you're the Troublemaker. You're trying to confuse us. I think Heidi is the Werewolf."
Heidi talks: "Alright, let's vote. Who do you guys think is the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "I vote for Frank. I still think he's acting suspicious."
Frank talks: "I vote for Heidi. She's been acting strange, and she's the Troublemaker."
Heidi talks: "Okay, it's a tie. We need to discuss more. Charlie, why do you think Frank is the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "Well, he's been acting suspicious, always looking around and whispering to himself. And he's been trying to blame me, which makes me think he's trying to distract us from the real Werewolf."
Frank talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to figure out who it could be. Charlie, you're acting strange, and Heidi, you're the Troublemaker. You're trying to confuse us. I think Heidi is the Werewolf."
