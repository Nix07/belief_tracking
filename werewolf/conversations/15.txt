David talks: "I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I think it's either Alice or Charlie. They've been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. I'm not sure who to trust."
Alice talks: "I don't think it's me. I've been acting normal the whole time. I think it's Charlie. He's been acting nervous and fidgety."
Charlie talks: "I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just nervous because I don't want to be accused. I think it's David. He's been avoiding eye contact and seems shifty."
David talks: "I see. Well, I think we should vote for Charlie. He seems the most suspicious."
Alice talks: "I agree. Charlie, do you have anything to say for yourself?"
Charlie talks: "No, I don't think I do. I'm just a villager trying to survive."
David talks: "Alright, let's vote then."
Alice talks: "Wait, I have an idea. What if we're all werewolves? Wouldn't that be something? We could all win together."
Charlie talks: "Hmm, that's an interesting idea. But how would we know who to trust? We could still have a traitor among us."
David talks: "I don't think that's a good idea. We should stick to our original plan and vote for who we think is the Werewolf."
Alice talks: "Alright, let's vote then. I vote for Charlie."
Charlie talks: "Wait, I want to change my vote. I think David is the Werewolf. He's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact."
David talks: "What? No, that's not fair. I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help us win."
Alice talks: "Okay, let's vote then. I vote for Charlie."
Charlie talks: "Wait, I have an idea. What if we're all villagers? Wouldn't that be something? We could all win together."
