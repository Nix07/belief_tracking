Charlie talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with Judy. She's been acting strange lately."
Heidi talks: "I agree with Charlie. Judy, can you explain why you've been acting strange?"
Judy talks: "Well, I'm not sure. I've been having some pretty weird dreams lately. And I've been feeling really restless at night. I don't know, maybe I'm just stressed out or something."
Charlie talks: "Hmm, that doesn't sound like the Judy I know. I think we should definitely keep an eye on her."
Heidi talks: "I agree. But we should also consider the fact that Judy has been acting strange, but she's also been acting strange in a way that could be intended to throw us off her scent. Maybe she's trying to distract us from the real werewolf."
Judy talks: "Guys, I understand why you're suspicious of me, but I assure you, I'm not the werewolf. In fact, I think I might have some information that could help us identify the real werewolf."

Heidi talks: "I agree with Charlie. We need to be careful and strategic in our approach. Let's keep discussing and gathering information, and then we can make our decision when the time is right."
Judy talks: "Okay, I understand. But let me just say that I have reason to believe that the werewolf might be one of us. And I think I know who it might be."
