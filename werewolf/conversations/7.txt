Eve talks: "Friends, I'm not sure who the Werewolf is, but I have a plan. Since I'm the Troublemaker, I swapped Charlie and Grace's cards last night. So, Charlie, you might be the Werewolf, or Grace might be. I'm not sure, but I'm hoping one of you will reveal your true identity. Let's discuss and vote wisely."
Charlie talks: "Eve, I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but I think you're trying to distract us from the real Werewolf. I think Grace might be the Werewolf. She's been acting strange and avoiding eye contact. Let's vote for Grace."
Grace talks: "Guys, I'm not sure what's going on here. I'm not the Werewolf, I swear. I think Charlie might be the Werewolf. He's been acting suspiciously and seems nervous. Let's vote for Charlie."
Eve talks: "Friends, I understand your concerns, but let's not jump to conclusions. We need more information. Charlie, Grace, do either of you have any alibis for last night? Did either of you see the Werewolf?"
Charlie talks: "Eve, I didn't see anything last night. But, I do have an alibi. I was with Grace last night. We went for a walk together. So, I know she's not the Werewolf."
Grace talks: "That's true, Charlie. I was with him last night. But, I think Eve might be the Werewolf. She's been acting strange and seems to be trying to distract us. Let's vote for Eve."
Eve talks: "Friends, I understand your suspicions, but I assure you, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help us identify the real Werewolf. Since Charlie and Grace were together last night, that means the Werewolf is either one of them, or someone else entirely. Let's not vote yet. We need more information. Who else has an alibi or saw something suspicious last night?"
Charlie talks: "Eve, I think we should trust Grace. She's been acting strange, but she's also been acting strange since the beginning of the game. I think she's just nervous. I still think the Werewolf is you, Eve. Let's vote for Eve."
Grace talks: "I agree with Charlie. Eve, you've been acting strange and seem to be trying to distract us. I think we should vote for you."
