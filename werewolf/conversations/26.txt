Grace talks: "Hey guys, I think we should be careful with each other. We don't know who the Werewolf is yet. Let's not jump to conclusions."
Ivan talks: "I agree with Grace. We should be careful. I think we should look for inconsistencies in each other's stories. That might help us identify the Werewolf."
Frank talks: "I agree with both of you. We should be careful and look for inconsistencies. But we should also be mindful of the Troublemaker. They might try to confuse us and make us doubt each other."
Grace talks: "That's a good point, Frank. We should be careful of the Troublemaker. But we should also try to figure out who the Troublemaker is. Maybe they'll make a mistake and reveal themselves."
Ivan talks: "I think we should take this discussion seriously. We can't afford to make mistakes. I swapped your cards last night, Grace and Frank. I hope that helps us identify the Werewolf."
Frank talks: "Thanks for the information, Ivan. That helps us narrow it down. But we should still be careful. The Werewolf might try to blend in and make us doubt each other."
Grace talks: "I agree. We should be careful and keep discussing. Maybe we can figure out who the Werewolf is before the night phase."
Ivan talks: "I think we're on the right track. Let's keep discussing and see if we can identify the Werewolf."
Frank talks: "Okay, let's sum it up. We know that the Werewolf is either Grace or Ivan. The Troublemaker is either me or Ivan. We should keep discussing and see if we can figure out who the Werewolf and Troublemaker are."
Grace talks: "Okay, I think we've discussed enough. Let's vote. I vote for Ivan."
Ivan talks: "I understand why you'd vote for me, Grace. But I'm not the Werewolf. I swapped your card with Frank's last night. I think Frank might be the Werewolf."
Frank talks: "I understand why you'd suspect me, Ivan. But I'm not the Werewolf. I think Grace might be the Werewolf. She's been acting suspiciously."
Grace talks: "I'm not the Werewolf! I'm just trying to figure out who it is. I think we should keep discussing and see if we can come to a consensus."
Ivan talks: "I agree with Grace. Let's keep discussing and see if we can figure out who the Werewolf is."
Frank talks: "Okay, let's keep discussing. But we should be careful. The Werewolf might try to blend in and make us doubt each other."
