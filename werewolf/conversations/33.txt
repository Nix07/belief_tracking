Grace talks: "Hey guys, I'm Troublemaker. I swapped your cards last night. Charlie, you're now a Villager, and Eve, you're the Werewolf. I'm still a Troublemaker. Let's discuss and vote to eliminate the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "Hey Grace, I'm glad you're on our side. Eve, you've been acting strange lately. I think you might be the Werewolf. What do you think, Grace?"
Eve talks: "Hey Charlie, I'm glad you're concerned about me, but I'm not the Werewolf. I think Grace might be the Werewolf. She's been avoiding eye contact and seems nervous. What do you think, Charlie?"
Grace talks: "Guys, I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help identify the real one. Charlie, you're a Villager now, and I swapped your card. You should trust me. Eve, you're the Werewolf, and I have no reason to lie. Let's vote and eliminate the Werewolf."
Charlie talks: "Hmm, I'm not sure who to believe. I think we should discuss more and gather more information before voting."
Eve talks: "I agree with Charlie. Let's discuss more and see if we can get more information before voting."
Grace talks: "Okay, let's discuss more. But remember, time is running out, and the Werewolf might eliminate someone tonight if we don't vote soon."
Charlie talks: "Okay, let me think. Eve, can you tell me what you did last night? Maybe that can help me understand your behavior."
Eve talks: "Well, Charlie, last night I was out for a walk, enjoying the full moon. I didn't want to disturb anyone, so I kept to myself. That's why I didn't interact much with anyone."
Grace talks: "Hmm, that sounds suspicious, Eve. I think we should vote now before it's too late."
Charlie talks: "Wait, let me ask Grace something. Grace, you said you swapped our cards last night. How do we know you're not the Werewolf and just trying to confuse us?"
Eve talks: "Good point, Charlie. Grace, can you prove you're not the Werewolf?"
Grace talks: "Well, guys, I don't have any physical proof. But I swear I'm not the Werewolf. I'm just trying to help identify the real one. You can trust me."
Charlie talks: "Hmm, I'm still not sure who to believe. I think we should keep discussing and see if we can get more information before voting."
Eve talks: "I agree with Charlie. Let's keep discussing and see if we can get more information before voting. Maybe someone else has some information that can help us identify the Werewolf."
